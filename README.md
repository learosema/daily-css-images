# Daily CSS Images Challenge!

Hello everyone. I'm taking on the Daily CSS Images challenge with my own rules. These are:

 * I chose the day's theme and it will not match with the one from the official [daily CSS Images](https://dailycssimages.com). I tried subscribing to the mail but it didn't work - so I will do the journey on my own.
 * I don't do any prefixing to support older browsers. Please just use a modern browser.
